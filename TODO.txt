DONE - chop the WebServer code...use curses instead
DONE - need ability to run without SERVER

- automate getting more accurate of these by turning the turntable very slowly until it stops
        self.TURN_BLOCKED_TOUCH_DEGREES = 112
        self.TURN_BLOCKED_SQUARE_TT_DEGREES = 40

- now that we figure out the cube size first thing, use that to init the turntable to the exact center?
    - not needed for 2x2x2 or 3x3x3 really, those cubes are pretty forgiving
    - would raise the cube and turn the turntable slowly until it stops, then turn back to center
    - would only need to do this on the very first solve
